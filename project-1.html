        description: "The dispersion properties of integrated optical waveguides were investigated using a Finite Difference Eigenmode solver, capable of handling arbitrary material compositions and structural configurations. Through this computational approach, a comprehensive analysis of modal refractive index characteristics was performed for various waveguide modes. Precise control of refractive index variations was subsequently demonstrated via optimized waveguide structural designs.",
